Authoracoin Core
=====================

Intro
-----
Authoracoin (ATHR) is a sustainable cryptocurrency modeled after 
Satoshi Nakamotoâ€™s vision for Bitcoin. It is a decentralized, 
peer-to-peer transactional currency designed to offer a solution to the problem posed 
by the exponential increase in energy consumed by Bitcoin and other proof-of-work currencies. 
Proof-of-work mining is environmentally unsustainable due to the electricity used by 
high-powered mining hardware. Authoracoin utilizes an energy efficient proof-of-stake algorithm, 
can be mined on any computer, and will never require specialized mining equipment. 
The Protocol offers a simple solution to Bitcoin sustainability issues and provides a faster, more scalable blockchain that is better suited for daily transactional use.

Authoracoin Core is the original Authoracoin client and it builds the backbone of the network.
However, it downloads and stores the entire history of Authoracoin transactions;
depending on the speed of your computer and network connection, the synchronization
process can take anywhere from a few hours to a day or more.
